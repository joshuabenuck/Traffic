This is my first marginally useful android app.

It is simply a WebView that loads a locally hosted static web page that then pulls images from tripcheck.com.

It is not customizable in any way and the camera choices are likely only useful for those who commute from Vancouver to Beaverton.

Click the tripcheck logo to refresh the page.
